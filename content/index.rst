GROMACS GPU performance
================================================

In this workshop, we will examine how GROMACS uses GPUs and
how you as a user can get the best value from that.

.. prereq::

   Experience running production simulations with GROMACS. General
   concepts will be introduced with brief descriptions that should be
   familiar to experienced MD users. Links to the GROMACS
   documentation will be used frequently.

Who is the course for?
----------------------

This material is targeted towards researchers who already have
experience with GROMACS and who would like to learn how to improve
simulation performance when running on GPUs.



About the course
----------------

This lesson material is developed by the `EuroCC National Competence
Center Sweden (ENCCS) <https://enccs.se/>`_ and taught in ENCCS
workshops. It is aimed at researchers and developers who already have
production experience with GROMACS. Each lesson episode has clearly defined learning
objectives and includes multiple exercises along with solutions, and
is therefore also useful for self-learning.
The lesson material is licensed under `CC-BY-4.0
<https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>`_ and can be reused in any form
(with appropriate credit) in other courses and workshops.
Instructors who wish to teach this lesson can refer to the :doc:`guide` for
practical advice.
